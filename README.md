# Image-Recognition
### (Recognize any object by studying features using convolution neural network)

In machine learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks,
most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
CNNs are often used in image recognition system.
The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding
a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters,
an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras.
By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues.
For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained categories such as the particular breed of dog or
species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this.

Here we have just developed a simple model with CNN to identify image of Cat or Dog.

Though a very small dataset is given,our Cnn Model is correctly identifying images of both.
